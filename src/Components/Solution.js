        In our experience, 80% of these mistakes can be eliminated by a thourough review process before the drawings are released for production. That is where we come in. We not only provide the
        services as every other 3D modeling "engineering" farm, we thoroughly review the drawings developed by our designers before publishing to our clients. We also will review the deign drawings
        (scantlings, onle line iagrams for piping and electrical, arrangement drawings etc..) to identify any potential issues from a 3D and from a regulation perspective. This ensures a smooth and
        proper 3D design of the vessel or structure.

      <p className="pt-4 px-2 leading-relaxed text-justify">We also provide support for launch calculations, stability analysis, regulatory review and approval.</p>

        But wait, that is not all. From years of working at shipyards, we know the everyday hassel shipyards face with module/unit lift and turn plans, yard questions, small structural calculations
        here and there. We are equipped to support all of that calculations and drawings using first principal or FE analysis depending on the complexity of the task.
